# Proxy Server for Front End Capstone project

This repo houses the proxy server for my front end capstone project.  The goal is to use the proxy server to serve up the gallery and reviews components created by Daniel Co and I as services in an effort to recreate a portion of Etsy's item sales page.  This project is intended purely to be an opportunity to expand our skill set and showcase our work.
