# Proxy Server for Halvsy

Welcome!  This browser houses a proxy server that I built to demo the Halvsy Gallery and Reviews components.

It's a fairly bare bones proxy server that renders the components on a blank html page and routes requests as necessary.  There were some additional features implemented to help improve performance while demoing the components such as a server-side cache utilizing memory-cache.  It was also dockerized for quick deployment via AWS.  However, as it was only a supporting project for the Halvsy components, it never really got the work put into it that it needed to be a stand-alone project.

If you have questions about the proxy server, or the Halvsy components, please feel free to reach out!  I'd be happy to discuss it.
